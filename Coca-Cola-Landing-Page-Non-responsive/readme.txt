Coca Cola Landing Page Project
This project is a static website that aims to recreate the landing page of the Coca Cola company. It is built using HTML and CSS, two fundamental technologies used in building websites.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. In this project, HTML is used to create the structure and content of the Coca Cola landing page. This includes elements like headers, paragraphs, links, images, and more.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS is a style-sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML. In this project, CSS is used to style the HTML elements to match the look of the Coca Cola landing page. This includes setting colors, fonts, layout properties, and more.

The goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and accurate representation of the Coca Cola landing page. This involves careful attention to detail in both the structure (HTML) and styling (CSS) of the page.

Please note that as this is a static page, it does not include any backend functionality or dynamic content. It serves as a great practice for front-end web development skills.
